# To-Do App
This is a clone of Apple's reminders app. This app is written in vanilla JS with very few dependencies. 

View the app [here](https://bshowen.github.io/to-do-app/).

# Database
I use localHost to persist your data in this application. I created a wrapper/api for working with localHost so that data can be created, updated, retrieved, and deleted with relative ease. 

# Notes
This app is not yet mobile friendly.
